## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Stacks Wallet

## 🔍 Contract Functions

### Public Functions

#### publish-content
```clarity
(define-public (publish-content 
  (title (string-utf8 256)) 
  (url (string-utf8 512)) 
  (description (string-utf8 1024))
))
```
Publishes a new content piece with verifiable ownership.

#### track-engagement
```clarity
(define-public (track-engagement 
  (content-id uint) 
  (engagement-type uint)
))
```
Records and verifies content engagement metrics.

### Read-Only Functions

#### get-content-details
```clarity
(define-read-only (get-content-details (content-id uint))
```
Retrieves comprehensive details about a published content piece.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Limitations
- Content record size constrained by block limits
- Engagement tracking has predefined metric types
- Single creator per content piece

### Best Practices
- Verify content ownership before publishing
- Use unique, descriptive content identifiers
- Monitor and validate engagement metrics
